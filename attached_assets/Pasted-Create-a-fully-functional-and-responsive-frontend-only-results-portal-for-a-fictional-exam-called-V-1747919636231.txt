Create a fully functional and responsive frontend-only results portal for a fictional exam called "VMMSET" (Vishal Mega Mart Security Entrance Test), using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website must closely match the layout, style, and feel of the **CBSE result portal** — including fonts, colors, table layout, button design, and overall structure.

It must **not use any backend** or frameworks. All validation and data must be handled in the browser using JavaScript.

### 👨‍💻 Website Overview

- **Title:** VMMSET Results Portal – 2025
- **Subtitle (below title):** Vishal Mega Mart Security Entrance Test
- **Design match:** Mimic the UI of official CBSE result portals – use formal, minimalistic design with proper spacing, a white content box on a blue or grey background, professional fonts, clean tables, and real-looking layout.

---

### 📱 Responsive Design

- Ensure full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using pure CSS (media queries).
- On small screens, stack form elements and adjust table widths for visibility.

---

### 🧾 Input Form Page

Include the following input fields styled like CBSE’s portal:

1. **Roll Number** (10-digit input field) – e.g., 2311200171
2. **Admit Card ID** – e.g., VMMSET2025-AXU723
3. **Security Code (CAPTCHA)** – randomly generated alphanumeric code (like 9T5YB)
4. **Submit Button** – labeled “Check Result”

#### ✅ Validation Logic

- Validate all fields are filled.
- Match Roll Number and Admit Card ID with mock data stored in JavaScript.
- If CAPTCHA is incorrect, show a styled error message like: “Incorrect Security Code”
- If Roll Number and Admit Card don’t match, show: “Invalid credentials. Please try again.”

### 📄 Result Page

After successful login, display a result sheet styled like CBSE portals. Include:

- **Student Details:**
  - Name
  - Roll Number
  - Admit Card ID
  - Examination Year: 2025

- **Subject-wise Marks Table**:
  - Trolley Handling – /100
  - Billing Counter Etiquette – /100
  - Store Surveillance – /100
  - Aisle Navigation – /100
  - Mega Mart Code of Conduct – /100
  - Total Marks: /500
  - Result: PASSED / FAILED (decide based on marks)

- Display results in a bordered table similar to CBSE result format.

- Add:
  - **Print Result** button (uses `window.print()`)
  - **Check Another Result** button (returns to form)
